# Real-Time-Fraudulent-Call-Detection-System
This project focuses on the development of a real-time fraudulent call detection system designed to identify potential phone scams and protect users from malicious activities. 
With the rise in phone-based scams targeting vulnerable individuals, this system offers a proactive approach in safeguarding users through real-time audio analysis and keyword detection.
The core of the system utilizes Python-based audio processing libraries such as speech recognition and py audio to transcribe live call audio and analyze the text for scam-related keywords. 
The system flags suspicious phrases and raises alerts, empowering users to make informed decisions. 
Designed for use with speaker mode or an AUX cable setup, the solution is lightweight, efficient, and adaptable for various phone-to-PC configurations.
